# Object_Detection_DL
An exploration of basic Deep Learning classification and object detection techniques. This repository is a basic guide to getting started with object detection, and perhaps computer vision more generally. A basic knowledge of ML concepts, Python, and Pytorch are assumed, but hopefully will be easy to follow for anyone who is interested! 

## Outline 
### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Datasets
1. The main dataset we choose for is from kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/animal-faces). This dataset includes 200 images of raccoons and a csv file with coordinates for the upper left and lower right corners of bounding boxes identifying where each raccoon is (see adorable example below).
